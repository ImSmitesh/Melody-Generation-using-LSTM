# üéµ Melody Generation Using LSTM

A deep learning project that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to generate musical melodies. This project processes MIDI files, trains an LSTM model on musical sequences, and generates new melodies based on learned patterns.

python preprocess.py
```

## Model Training

```bash
python train.py
```

## Melody Generation

```bash
python melodygenerator.py
```

## Model Architecture

#### Input
*   Integer-encoded musical sequences

#### LSTM Layers
*   Capture sequence patterns

#### Dense Layer
*   Predicts the next note (softmax activation)
